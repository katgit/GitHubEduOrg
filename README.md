Directions on Creating GitHub Educational Organization

1. Login to the [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. From the arrow next to the "+" sign on the right-upper corner select "New Organization".
- Set Organization account Name and Contact email. 
- Select "A business or institution" and provide the name of the institution (RCS, Boston University)
- Verify your account solving puzzle :)
- Accept Agreement

3. On The next screen ("Welcome to <organizational name>") you can add other people or skip it for right now and push "Complete setup" button.
GitHub will ask to go througth the 2FA.  

Once organization is created, **we need to "upgrade"**, so we have the "team" plan, but without monthly charges. The additional features in "team plan" include 
- issues
- wiki and pages
- GitHub pages
- other features and 2GB of Packages storage

### Part 1 - Requesting personal education discount from GitHub  
  
Request the GitHub education discount to tell GitHub your organisation will be used for research or teaching. This can be done in two ways:
  1. go to [GitHub Education] (https://education.github.com/globalcampus/teacher), select *Benefits* from the top navigation bar and then click the *Get teacher benefits* button
  2. click [this link](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/application) to go directly to the application page.

- On the next page select *Teacher*
- For the question *"What e-mail address do you use for school?"* question, select your BU email address.

    You will be prompted to upload proof of your academic status by uploading a proof of your University affiliation (this can be done by uploading a BU letterhead document that has your name in it) - if so follow the instructions on the page to complete this step.

 - For the question *"What is the name of your school?"* enter *Boston University*.

 - For the *"How do you plan to use GitHub?"* question you need to give a brief description of your intended research / teaching use cases - e.g., "Management of researcher-written code for modelling and simulation" or "Management of the projects of BU's Student Internship program".

 Once you have entered all the required information and checked it for accuracy click the **submit** button. You should receive a confirmation email in a few days.

### Part 2 - upgrade your organization to GitHub Team plan
Once your application has been approved go to the [GitHub Global Campus for teachers page](https://education.github.com/globalcampus/teacher) and click the **Upgrade to GitHub Team** button in the Upgrade your academic organizations section. After clicking the button you should be presented with a list of organization you own which can be upgraded to GitHub Team. Click the **Upgrade** button for the relevant organization.
